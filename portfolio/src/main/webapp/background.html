        Hello! My name is Oyin Sholeye. My name is in Yoruba and
        means "honey" in english. I am a Nigerian-American and very intuned with my culture. I enjoy
        watching Nollywood movies and learning how to cook nigerian food in my free time. Nollywood is the
        Nigerian equivalent of Hollywood.</p> 
        
        <p>I am attending Washington University in St. Louis. It is actually very common for people to mistake the 
        location of my school to be in either Seattle or Washington DC- even after I say "in St.Louis". I am 
        studying Computer Science with a minor in Psychology. I am invovled with different organizations on campus.
        I am the treasuer of National Society of Black Engineers, a member of the Proffesional Development Committe for 
        Women in Computer Science, and a Resident Advisor to freshaman students. </p>
