      Hello! My name is Oyin Sholeye. I was born on July 1, 2000 in Atlanta, Georgia.My name is in Yoruba and
      means "honey" in english. I am a Nigerian-American and very intuned with my culture. I enjoy
      watching Nollywood movies and learning how to cook nigerian food in my free time. Nollywood is the
      Nigerian equivalent of Hollywood.</p> 
    <p>I am attending Washington University in St. Louis. It is actually very common for people to mistake the 
      location of my school to be in either Seattle or Washington DC- even after I say "in St.Louis". I am 
      studying Computer Science with a minor in Psychology. I am invovled with different organizations on campus.
      I am the treasuer of National Society of Black Engineers, a member of the Proffesional Development Committe for 
      Women in Computer Science, and a Resident Advisor to freshaman students.</p>
    <p>I consider myself a foodie. I love trying new foods from different countries and cultures. I also love traveling.
      I plan on visiting Japan or Hong Kong in the near future.Next year, I hope to intern abroad.</p>
