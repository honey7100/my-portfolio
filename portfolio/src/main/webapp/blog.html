    <p> Today, I would like to share how attending Grace Hopper was a very influencial experience for me.
        Grace Hopper is a conference for women in computing.
        One day, as I was sitting in my "Introduction to Computering Engineering" class trying to figure out 
        an assignment, I was approached by one of the TA's. She told me that she noticed that I was in every 
        computer science class and asked if I had considered attending the Grace Hopper Conference. She went on to tell
        me that she got her internship offer to work at Facebook by going to the conference. I decided to apply 
        for the GHC scholarship that my engineering school created. I didn't expect to be selected for the scholarship, but
        I am so grateful that I was. MY school covered the hotel, flights, and ticket cost for me. I was super excited to 
        have the chance to network with companies and meet new people.Before arriving in Orlando for the conference, I expected to just go to the career fair and mind my 
        business. I am so happy to say that I made so many new friends. </p>
    <p>Day One of Grace Hopper was very overwhelming for me. I was in a space with 27,000 other girls. It also
        gave me a sense of belonging because these were girls who shared the same passion for technolgy and coding as me.
        I ended up meeting with a friend from high school while at the conference. It was really nice becuase we got to do a lot of catching
        up.</p>
    <p> The main reasons why Grace Hopper was so influencial:</p>
    <p> 1. I was able to interview with Google at the conference which led to me getting and accepting 
        and internship offer for STEP.</p>
    <p> 2. I was able to build new friendships with some wonderful girls.</p>
