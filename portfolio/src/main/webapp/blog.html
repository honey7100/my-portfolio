    <p> Today, I would like to share how attending Grace Hopper was a very influencial experience for me.
        Grace Hopper is a conference for women in computing.
        Before I got to college, I had no idea what Grace Hopper was. One day, as I was sitting in my "Introduction to
        Computering Engineering" class trying to figure out
        an assignment, I was approached by one of the TA's. She told me that she noticed that I was in every
        computer science class and asked if I had considered attending the Grace Hopper Conference. She went on to tell
        me how she got her internship offer to work at Facebook by going to the conference.I knew that I wanted to
        intern at a top tech company as well. I decided to apply
        for the GHC scholarship that my engineering school offered. I didn't expect to be selected for the scholarship,
        but I am so grateful that I was. My school covered the hotel, flights, and ticket cost for me. Th escholarship
        didn't cover food, but I was able to get fed through company networking events.
        I was super excited
        to go to my first conference.
        Before arriving in Orlando for the conference, I
        expected to just go to the career fair and mind my
        business. I am so happy to say that I made so many new friends. </p>
    <p>Day One of Grace Hopper was very overwhelming for me. I was in a space with 27,000 other girls. It also
        gave me a sense of belonging because these were girls who shared the same passion for technolgy and coding as
        me.
        I ended up meeting with a friend from high school while at the conference. It was really nice becuase we got to
        do a lot of catching
        up. She even snuck me in an invite-only event in Disney Springs!
        Day Two of Grace Hopper was so crazy becuase I had never been to a career fair so huge. There were top companies
        and startups that were looking to recruit. Luckily for me, my nerves were calmed because I prepared ahead of
        time.
    </p>
    <p> The main reasons why Grace Hopper was so influencial:</p>
    <p> 1. I was able to interview with Google at the conference which led to me getting and accepting
        and internship offer for STEP.</p>
    <p> 2. I was able to build new friendships with some wonderful girls.</p>
    <p>Would I do it again? Yes, yes I would!#GHC2020</p>
